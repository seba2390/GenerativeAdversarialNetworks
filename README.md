# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) Implementation in PyTorch

This repository contains implementations of a vanilla GAN and a DCGAN using PyTorch. 
GANs are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, and
DCGAN is a variant of GAN that uses convolutional layers in the generator and discriminator.
